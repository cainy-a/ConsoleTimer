[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cainy-a/ConsoleTimer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cainy-a/ConsoleTimer)

ConsoleTimer is a timer built in C# on Monodevelop, and compiled with Mono.
It can work as:
- a stopwatch, counting up in hours:minutes:seconds indefinitely,
- or as a countdown timer, counting down until it reaches 0:0:0.0

## How to run this application.
### Windows

### Mac and Linux
